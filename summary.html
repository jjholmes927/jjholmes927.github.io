        <p>
            Always open to collaborating on new and exciting opportunities.

            Things that are important to me:
                - Working on exciting challenging ambiguous problems.
                - An environment that provides autonomy/trust along with space for growth.
                - 'Product Engineering' style roles where being close to the end customer/problems is encouraged and
                  prioritised.
                - I'm interested in products powered by AI.
