                            <a href="https://www.fujitsu.com/uk/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">Fujitsu Services:</a> Graduate Scheme Software Developer
                            <br />
                            <br />Eager to get stuck in I joined the Fujitsu Graduate scheme as a Software Solutions Developer.
                            <br />During my time at Fujitsu my responsibilities ranged from getting involved at customer sites, and working in an Agile approach using scrum ceremonies, and DevOps concepts like CI/CD to aid the delivery and development of applications.
                            <br />
                            <br />One such example being to help develop a change management solution for the Post Office with NodeJs/TypeScript/React/MaterialUI and MYSQL.
                            <br />As well as my main focus of being a developer, I also spent some time acting as a scrum master for a team of junior talent which helped deepen my understanding of agile working due to performing multiple roles within that process.

                            <a href="https://reg.uk.com" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">REG Technologies:</a> Full Stack Software Engineer.
                            <br />
                            <br />After obtaining a lot of useful skills and perspective from working in a large global consultancy,
                            <br />I decided that to take my technical skills to the next level I would look for a more fast paced environment.
                            <br />
                            <br />The next step was linking up and joining the super ambitious and creative team at REG Technologies, as a FullStack Developer helping to grow and maintain their REG Tech compliance software, that enables insurance brokers immensely.
                            <br />Due to team skillset I was allocated as a resource mostly to the backend, this involved a TDD approach with automoq to build a microservice architecture in .NET. 
                            <br />
                            <br />I definitely got the fast paced environment I was craving due to a change in team size early on in my employment, I had to adapt rapidly and take on a lot of responsibility for production code in a short space of time. Although not my desired focus due to smaller team size I also had to get involved in maintaining and creating infrastructure for some of our .NET microservices in Kubernetes, which gave me great insight as a developer into the platform side of large scalable applications.

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I joined Earnd a Financial wellbeing company who empowers employees through flexibility and control over their own pay cycles.
                            The main attraction of Earnd to me was the collection of amazing knowledgable people from whom I felt I could learn extensively from to continue my growth as an Engineer.
