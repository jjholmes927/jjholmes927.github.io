                            <p>
                                As part of the graduate scheme, I rotated and experienced a few different roles and responsibilities.
                                <br />
                                The roles I fulfilled were: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Graduate DevOps Engineer</li>
                                <li>Graduate Software Developer</li>
                                <li>Scrum master</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <span>Furthermore, whilst at this role I gained a certification as a SAFe Product Owner.</span>
                            <p>
                                Experiencing these vastly different roles gave me an deeper appreciation and understanding, for the different elements of a successful team setup to work in a stereotypical agile way.

                            <p>
                                After working in a global consultancy I was really keen and hungry to be shipping at a faster pace,
                                I decided that to take my technical skills to the next level I would look for a more fast paced environment in a start up.
                            </p>
                            <p>    
                                I joined REG Technologies, where my main responsibilities revolved around building and mainintaing a .NET/Azure microservice based architecture to provide compliance software. 
                                
                                I definitely got the fast paced environment I was craving due to a change in team size early on in my employment, I had to adapt rapidly take on a lot of responsibility for production code in a short space of time.

                                I joined Earnd a Financial wellbeing company who empowered employees through flexibility and control over their own pay cycles.

                            <p>
                                Unfortunately due to unforseen circumstances, mainly the administration of the company this was a short lived gig.

                            <a href="https://gocardless.com/" style="color: white; text-decoration: underline;">GoCardless:</a> Software Engineer III
                            <p>
                                I have spent the last 3 years at GoCardless, In this time I achieved the things I'm most proud of in my career. 
                            
                                I was promoted twice in my first 18 months from Software Engineer I -> Software Engineer II -> Software Engineer III. 
                                Furthermore, In this time I was part of a new small team span up that got the chance to work closely with customers and build a new product from scratch 'GoCardless Embed'.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At GoCardless I was afforded the opportunities to work on 3 different teams, which meant I was able to work accross the product and stack.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Firstly, I spent 9 Months in the Merchant Experience team. This teams responsibilities were around mainintaining and building out our core APIs Payments/Mandates/Refunds, our recurring subscription logic and SDKs.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                After this I joined our Front End Interfaces team for 9 months as a more backend leaning fullstack engineer to help unblock a team of front end engineers, this team looked after our
                                design system, dashboard, MFA, Sign-in and we worked on a rebrand during this time.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Finally, I spent the last year and a half at this role as part of the new Payment Providers team tasked with taking our core product and whitelabelling it so we could power other
                                payment service providers. 
                                <br />
                                My responsibilities as part of this team included but were not limited to, scoping/leading design work for how we should build and implement our system, mentoring other engineers, working closely with product and customers to help shape our roadmap and what was important to work on and collaborating cross functionally to ensure alignment with other business areas on what we were trying to achieve.
